####These directions work for a new HTML5 document created in Cloud9.

1. Create a heroku account by signing up at heroku.com

2. In Cloud9, create an index.php file that contains this line of code:
	<?php include_once("index.html"); ?>
   where index.html is your main html document

3. Type ‘git init’ without quotes into terminal of Cloud9 project and press return

4. In Cloud9, click on the deploy button (the hot air balloon) and click the plus button to add heroku as a deploy target. Enter your account information and add a new target.

5. Go to https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps and click on the newly created target and then go to settings for that app. Copy the Git URL (should be in form of ‘git@heroku.com:name-of-app.git’).

6. In Cloud9 terminal, type ‘git remote add heroku’ without quotes and paste the Git URL after that then press return (your line should look like ‘git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:name-of-app.git’)

####This will create the website. 

Now after new changes, go to the terminal and type in ‘git add --all’ and hit return. Next, type ‘git commit -m “message of your commit”’ and hit return (include the inner double quotes with a message inside that will indicate what the updates are). Next, type ‘git push heroku master’ and hit return. Your changes will now be updated on your website (which can be accessed at name-of-app.herokuapp.com)
