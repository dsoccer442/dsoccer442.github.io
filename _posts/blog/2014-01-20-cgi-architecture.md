<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/7809605" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/7809605" target="_blank">The Third & The Seventh</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user1337612" target="_blank">Alex Roman</a>.

When I first watched this video, I was under the impression that Alex Roman had filmed on location and added a few minor animations on top of the film, or even superimposed two videos on top of each other. It wasn't until the very end, when I took the time to actually read the description, that I realized he had created this breathtaking production entirely on the computer. I can't even imagine how long it would take someone to create thisâ€“3 months if they worked solely on it, maybe a year if it was a side project? Either way, I'm glad that he uploaded <a href="http://vimeo.com/8217700" target="_blank">a video</a> on how he created one of the buildings.
