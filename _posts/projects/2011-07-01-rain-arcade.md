Rain Arcade is a mobile game development company focused on creating iOS puzzle games. Founded in 2012 through the StudentRND Incubator summer program, Rain Arcade serves to provide quality entertainment for your mobile devices. I worked as a developer for the game [Mole Run](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mole-run/id553609578?mt=8 "Mole Run"), a game we made for the iPhone and iPod Touch. We used the CoronaSDK so that the game could be coded for both iOS and Android devices. For more information check out [our website](http://rainarcade.com/ "Rain Arcade").
