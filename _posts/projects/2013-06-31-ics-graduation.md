The ICS Graduation websites was made for the FBLA E-business competition and won first place at the national competition. It provides a system for students and other family members to purchase tickets to the graduation ceremony. It uses PHP in the backend to handle ticket requests and checkout services, but does not actually accept payment per competition guidelines.
