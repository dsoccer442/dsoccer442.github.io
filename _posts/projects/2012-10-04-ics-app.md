The [ICS App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ics-app/id557809147?mt=8 "ICS App") is the first mobile application in the Lake Washington School District, and was created specifically for the students, teachers, and parents of the International Community School in Kirkland. It offers the ability for students to receive alerts about upcoming school events or other announcements, find out about meetings for specific clubs, view their grades through online StandardsScore service, and contact teachers or the school with a staff directory. The application was coded in Objective-C with help from online tutorials and examples. There will be a an update of the application soon with better design and user interaction.
