				<title>Adding Heroku to Cloud9</title>
				<description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;these-directions-work-for-a-new-html5-document-created-in-cloud9&quot;&gt;These directions work for a new HTML5 document created in Cloud9.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Create a heroku account by signing up at heroku.com&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Cloud9, create an index.php file that contains this line of code:
 &lt;?php include_once(&quot;index.html&quot;); ?&gt;
where index.html is your main html document&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Type ‘git init’ without quotes into terminal of Cloud9 project and press return&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Cloud9, click on the deploy button (the hot air balloon) and click the plus button to add heroku as a deploy target. Enter your account information and add a new target.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go to https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps and click on the newly created target and then go to settings for that app. Copy the Git URL (should be in form of ‘git@heroku.com:name-of-app.git’).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Cloud9 terminal, type ‘git remote add heroku’ without quotes and paste the Git URL after that then press return (your line should look like ‘git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:name-of-app.git’)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;this-will-create-the-website&quot;&gt;This will create the website.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now after new changes, go to the terminal and type in ‘git add –all’ and hit return. Next, type ‘git commit -m “message of your commit”’ and hit return (include the inner double quotes with a message inside that will indicate what the updates are). Next, type ‘git push heroku master’ and hit return. Your changes will now be updated on your website (which can be accessed at name-of-app.herokuapp.com)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Go Hawks!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;With a lul in homework, my friend and I decided to make a Seattle Seahawks highlight reel for the Super Bowl. Clips are from various YouTube videos and music is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH-BP4K8NAs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;12th Man by NoClue&lt;/a&gt;. Hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>CGI Is Amazing</title>
				<description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://player.vimeo.com/video/7809605&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/7809605&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Third &amp;amp; The Seventh&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/user1337612&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alex Roman&lt;/a&gt;.

When I first watched this video, I was under the impression that Alex Roman had filmed on location and added a few minor animations on top of the film, or even superimposed two videos on top of each other. It wasn&#39;t until the very end, when I took the time to actually read the description, that I realized he had created this breathtaking production entirely on the computer. I can&#39;t even imagine how long it would take someone to create this–3 months if they worked solely on it, maybe a year if it was a side project? Either way, I&#39;m glad that he uploaded &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/8217700&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; on how he created one of the buildings.
&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Museum of Math</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;New York City now boasts the newly constructed &lt;a href=&quot;http://momath.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MoMath&lt;/a&gt;, which opened up on December 6th. I had the chance to visit the new museum and even got an after hours interview with Glen Whitney, the executive director for the museum. Whitney, 42, previously worked at Renaissance Technologies hedge fund as a quantitative analyst and as a math professor. Asked about his motivation for the creation of MoMath, Whitney cited his passion for mathematics. He wants kids, and adults alike, to see math how it truly is–not as a set of recipes that lead to the right answer if followed exactly–but as creative, diverse, and beautiful. In fact, according to Whitney, &lt;strong&gt;“Math is one of the few subjects that someone can still readily discover the unknown and then create from that.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though aimed at ages 9-14, the hands-on exhibits were enthraling even to me, as high schooler. For example, “math squares” creates virtual puzzels on a LED floor that change ever so often and advance to harder levels as you solve the problems. As well, “Square-wheel trike” represents the multi-aged engagement that Whitney wanted to offer: experiences that everyone from a kindergartener to a pHD professor would be interested in. Young kids view the bike as a fun ride, while high schoolers see the relation of geometry in wheels and ground, while, finally, graduate-level mathematicians understand the differential equations needed to find the shapes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The museum helps students understand that math is connected to architecture, nature, roller coasters, music and art. Whitney commented on this, saying that he wants to encourage kids to go into math fields with pass ion and hopes that MoMath can be the experience that sets them on that course. Whitney hopes to spread the idea of creativity and discovery in math across the country to help the math deficient in America, because &lt;strong&gt;“if you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
